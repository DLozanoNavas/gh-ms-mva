# Course Title:Â GitHub for Windows Users
## Module 1: Basic Concepts and the GitHub Workflow
I thought we'd use this module to...
- do some introductions to the presenters
- some background on source control and rise in popularity of git and GitHub
- Microsoft's reluctant adoption of the alternative, distributed source control philosophy
- the difference between central and distributed models
- the distinction between git and GitHub
- the branch, merge, commit workflow
- etc.

## Module 2: GitHub in the Browser
I'm thinking that it would be helpful to start by just doing all of the stuff that you can do in the browser like...
- creating repos
- adding contributors
- using organizations
- basic text editing
- pull requests (might save for module 6)
- etc.

## Module 3: GitHub Desktop
All the details on installing and using Desktop, launching it from the browser, etc.

## Module 4: GitHub Integrations with Visual Studio
The relative ease of simply doing source control from your IDE. We would show Visual Studio as well as Visual Studio Code.
- Visual Studio 2015
  - Developer Assistant
  - Visual Studio Tools for Git
  - GitHub Extension for Visual Studio
    - Installation
    - Creating a repo
    - A common scenario: a fork, a mod, and a PR
- Visual Studio Code


## Module 5: GitHub on the Command Line
I would really like to do an entire module on using the command line to issue git commands and also show how to install the _gh_ module in npm and use it to manage repos, users, etc. This module might be an attempt to encourage otherwise GUI-dependent developers to start to embrace the command line.
- Installing Git
  - Install GitHub Desktop
  - Poshgit
  - GitHub for Windows
  - cmder
- Installing the gh node cli
  - Creating a repo
- Looking up command help
- Adding the git bin to get a lot of basic Linux commands (ssh, scp, touch, etc.)

## Module 6: Beyond the Basics
This would be a grab bag of more in-depth or advanced  concepts. Here we talk about pull requests, submodules, continuous deployment from GH to Azure, perhaps rebasing, cherry picking, stashing, etc. (that may be too much)
